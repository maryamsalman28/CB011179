    <h1>THREATS</h1>

<div class="clearfix">

  <h2>Natural predators </h2>
  <p>The survival of turtle populations is seriously threatened by natural predators, which have an effect on population size and health. Turtle hatchlings and adults are seen as a possible food source by predators including birds, crabs, raccoons, and sharks. Predation occurs naturally as part of the ecosystem, although human action can lessen its effects. Vulnerable eggs and hatchlings can be safeguarded by putting predator exclusion measures in place, such building barriers around nesting areas. Except for the rare shark assault, sea turtles are relatively immune to predators after they reach adulthood.
  Conservations such as

    <h2>Human-caused threats </h2>
    <p>Turtle populations are seriously threatened by human activity, which jeopardises their survival. Human activity has a harmful effect on turtle populations in a number of ways, including coastal development, pollution, habitat degradation, and unsustainable fishing methods. People may also utilize the oil, cartilage, skin, and shell of the turtle as well as other components of the animal to make items. It is essential to increase public knowledge of how human activities affect turtles and their ecosystems in order to address these problems. Important initiatives include minimizing plastic waste, supporting ethical fishing practices, and implementing and enforcing legislation to safeguard nesting beaches. Fostering a sense of guardianship for turtles and their habitats may be achieved by involving local people, running educational programs, and providing support for conservation efforts.
      Conservations such as  <a target="_blank" href="https://themightyroar.com/projects/sri-lanka-sea-turtle-conservation">The Mighty Roar</a> could also help reduce this threat.

    <h2>Marine plastic pollution </h2>
    <p>Sea turtles are increasingly and seriously threatened by plastic waste. These magnificent animals frequently confuse floating plastic waste for food, which can result in ingesting it and consequent health problems. According to a research done on young loggerhead turtles, 15% of the turtles had consumed significant amounts of plastic that prevented their stomachs from working normally. Collective effort is necessary to address this urgent problem, including lowering plastic usage, careful recycling, and backing programs for effective waste management and beach cleanups. We can protect sea turtles' health and the sensitive marine environments they live in by actively combating plastic litter. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.projects-abroad.org/blog/how-we-can-help-save-sea-turtles/">Find out more about what is happening to sea turtles and what you can do to help.</a></p>
